# Google Drive Copy Links

This folder contains the code for a Google Workspace Add-on that provides a sidebar with copyable links to the selected documents.

## Why?

I often need to copy/paste links to multiple Google Drive documents and it is time-consuming. [Read more about the problem](https://metaist.com/blog/2023/07/google-drive-links.html), and [how I built this solution](https://metaist.com/blog/2023/07/google-drive-links-workspace-add-on.html).

## Required Permissions

This add-on needs to get the name and URL of each selected document in Google Drive. Therefore, it needs not only `drive.addons.metadata.readonly` but also `drive.readonly`.

## Install

_I will update this section when the add-on is approved on the Google Workspace Marketplace._
